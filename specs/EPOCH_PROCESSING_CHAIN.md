# Complete Epoch Processing Data Flow Chain

This document verifies that all inputs and outputs are properly defined and flow correctly through the entire protocol chain.

## Chain Sequence
```
Belief Aggregation → Mirror Descent → Learning Assessment → BTS Scoring → Stake Redistribution
```

## Data Flow Verification

### 1. Belief Aggregation
**Inputs:**
- `belief_id` (from request)
- `{p_i}` - Agent beliefs (loaded from DB)
- `{m_i}` - Agent meta-predictions (loaded from DB)
- `{S_i}` - Agent stakes (loaded from DB)
- Active agent indicators (loaded from DB)
- `P_post^(t-1)` - Previous epoch's post-MD aggregate (loaded from DB)

**Outputs:**
- `P_pre` - Pre-mirror descent aggregate
- `D_JS` - Jensen-Shannon disagreement entropy
- `D̂_JS` - Normalized disagreement entropy  
- `c` - Certainty
- `{m_i}` - Agent meta-predictions (pass-through)
- Active agent indicators (pass-through)

### 2. Mirror Descent
**Inputs:** ✅ All available from Aggregation
- `belief_id` (from request)
- `P_pre` ← from Aggregation
- `c` ← from Aggregation
- Active agent indicators ← from Aggregation
- `{p_i^(t)}` - Current agent beliefs (loaded from DB)

**Outputs:**
- `{p_i^(t+1)}` - Updated beliefs for all agents
- `P_post` - Post-mirror descent aggregate
- `D_JS,post` - Post-mirror descent disagreement entropy

### 3. Learning Assessment
**Inputs:** ✅ All available from Mirror Descent + DB
- `belief_id` (from request)
- `D_JS,post^(t)` ← from Mirror Descent
- `D_JS,previous` (loaded from DB)

**Outputs:**
- `learning_occurred` - Boolean
- `ΔD_JS` - Disagreement entropy reduction
- `η_econ` - Economic learning rate

### 4. BTS Scoring
**Inputs:** ✅ All available from previous steps + DB
- `belief_id` (from request)
- `{p_i^(t+1)}` ← from Mirror Descent (updated beliefs)
- `{m_i}` ← from Aggregation (meta-predictions)
- `{S_i}` (loaded from DB - agent stakes)
- Active agent indicators ← from Aggregation

**Outputs:**
- `{s_i}` - BTS signal quality scores
- `{g_i}` - Information scores
- `W` - Winner set
- `L` - Loser set

### 5. Stake Redistribution
**Inputs:** ✅ All available from previous steps + DB
- `belief_id` (from request)
- `learning_occurred` ← from Learning Assessment
- `η_econ` ← from Learning Assessment
- `{g_i}` ← from BTS Scoring
- `W` ← from BTS Scoring (winner set)
- `L` ← from BTS Scoring (loser set)
- `{S_i}` (loaded from DB - current agent stakes)

**Outputs:**
- `{S_i'}` - Updated stakes after redistribution
- `{ΔR_i}` - Individual rewards for winners
- `{ΔS_j}` - Individual slashes for losers

## Verification Results

✅ **Chain is Complete**: Every function has all required inputs available from previous functions or database.

✅ **No Missing Dependencies**: No function requires data that isn't provided by a previous step.

✅ **Correct Sequence**: Learning Assessment now correctly comes after Mirror Descent (fixed the temporal paradox).

✅ **Pass-through Data Handled**: Meta-predictions and active agent indicators properly flow from Aggregation to downstream functions.

✅ **Database Interactions Clear**: Each function knows exactly what to load from DB vs what comes from previous functions.

## Edge Function Implementation Ready

All protocol specs and edge function specs are now synchronized with:
- Matching input/output parameters
- Correct function call sequence
- Complete data flow chain
- No circular dependencies
- No missing data requirements

The edge functions can now be implemented with confidence that the chain will work end-to-end.
