# Dashboard Test Suite Overview

Comprehensive testing strategy for dashboard-specific functions that provide detailed protocol monitoring capabilities.

## Test Structure

```

├── belief-submissions.test.ts    # Tests for /dashboard/beliefs/get-submissions
├── dashboard-feed.test.ts        # Tests for /dashboard/posts/get-feed
├── integration.test.ts           # Cross-function integration tests
└── performance.test.ts           # Performance and load tests
```

## Testing Philosophy

### 1. **Protocol Data Accuracy**
Dashboard functions must provide accurate, real-time protocol state data for monitoring and debugging. Tests verify:
- Correct stake calculations
- Accurate belief aggregations
- Complete submission histories
- User attribution integrity

### 2. **Performance Under Load**
Dashboard queries are more complex than regular feed queries. Tests ensure:
- Acceptable response times with realistic data volumes
- Efficient database query patterns
- Proper handling of concurrent requests
- Graceful degradation under load

### 3. **Error Resilience**
Dashboard must remain functional even when parts of the protocol are failing. Tests verify:
- Partial data presentation when services are down
- Clear error messaging for administrators
- Continued operation despite individual failures
- Proper logging for debugging

## Data Dependencies

### Test Data Requirements
```
Users: alice, bob, charlie, admin
Agents: agent-alice, agent-bob, agent-charlie
Beliefs: 3-5 test beliefs with varying states
Submissions: Mix of active/inactive submissions
Stakes: Realistic stake distributions
```

### Database State Management
- Setup: Create consistent test data before each test suite
- Isolation: Each test operates on independent data
- Cleanup: Remove test data after completion
- Reset: Return to known state between tests

## Test Categories Priority

### **P0 (Critical)**
- Basic endpoint functionality
- Data structure validation
- Essential error handling
- Security validation

### **P1 (Important)**
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge case handling
- Integration scenarios
- Data consistency

### **P2 (Nice to Have)**
- Load testing
- Extended error scenarios
- Optimization verification
- User experience edge cases

## Success Criteria

### **Functional Tests**
- ✅ All endpoints return correct data structure
- ✅ Stake calculations match epistemic weights
- ✅ User attribution is accurate
- ✅ Error responses are appropriate

### **Performance Tests**
- ✅ Response times meet benchmarks
- ✅ Memory usage is reasonable
- ✅ Database query efficiency
- ✅ Concurrent request handling

### **Integration Tests**
- ✅ Dashboard feed includes all submission data
- ✅ Cross-function data consistency
- ✅ Real protocol state reflection
- ✅ End-to-end data flow validation

## Implementation Notes

### **Test Execution Order**
1. Unit tests for individual functions
2. Integration tests for function interactions
3. Performance tests with realistic loads
4. End-to-end protocol state validation

### **Mock vs Real Data**
- **Real protocol calculations**: Use actual epistemic weights functions
- **Real database operations**: Test against actual schema
- **Mock external dependencies**: Stub non-essential services
- **Controlled test environment**: Isolated from production data

This testing strategy ensures dashboard functions provide reliable, accurate protocol monitoring capabilities while maintaining good performance and error handling.
