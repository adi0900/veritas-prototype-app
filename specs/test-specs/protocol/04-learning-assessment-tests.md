# Learning Assessment Test Specification

Test specification for `/protocol/beliefs/learning-assessment` function.

## Critical Properties to Verify

### **P1: Learning Detection Accuracy**
**Property**: Learning occurs iff `entropy_reduction > EPSILON_PROBABILITY`
**Test**: Verify threshold-based learning detection is precise

### **P2: Entropy Reduction Calculation**
**Property**: `entropy_reduction = previous_entropy - current_entropy` (exact arithmetic)
**Test**: No precision loss in subtraction, handles negative results

### **P3: Economic Learning Rate Bounds**
**Property**: `0 ≤ economic_learning_rate ≤ 1`
**Test**: Rate always within valid probability bounds

### **P4: Economic Rate Division Handling**
**Property**: When `previous_entropy ≈ 0`, `economic_rate = 0` (avoid division by zero)
**Test**: Graceful handling of near-zero denominators

### **P5: State Update Atomicity**
**Property**: `previous_disagreement_entropy` updated exactly once per call
**Test**: Database state update is atomic and consistent

### **P6: Learning Monotonicity**
**Property**: True learning implies `entropy_reduction > 0`
**Test**: No false positive learning detection
