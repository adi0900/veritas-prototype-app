# VeritasCustodian Test Specification

## Test Environment
- **Framework:** Anchor Test Suite
- **Runtime:** Solana Test Validator (localnet)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Location:** `/solana/veritas-curation/tests/`

## Critical Test Categories

### 1. Custodian Initialization

#### 1.1 Singleton Custodian Creation
**Purpose:** Verify single custodian instance with pooled model
```typescript
it("initializes custodian with owner and protocol authority")
// Setup: Deploy program
// Action: Initialize with owner and protocol_authority
// Assert: Custodian PDA created at correct address
// Assert: USDC vault created and owned by custodian PDA
// Assert: owner and protocol_authority set correctly
// Assert: emergency_pause = false
// Assert: total_deposits = 0, total_withdrawals = 0

it("prevents duplicate custodian initialization")
// Action: Try to initialize custodian again
// Assert: Account already exists error
```

#### 1.2 Authority Validation
**Purpose:** Prevent invalid authorities
```typescript
it("rejects custodian with default pubkey authorities")
it("rejects custodian with system program authorities")
// Test both owner and protocol_authority
// Assert: InvalidAuthority errors
```

### 2. Deposit Operations

#### 2.1 Permissionless Deposits
**Purpose:** Verify anyone can deposit to pool
```typescript
it("allows any user to deposit USDC")
// Setup: User with USDC balance
// Action: Deposit 1000 USDC
// Assert: USDC transferred to custodian vault
// Assert: total_deposits increased by 1000
// Assert: DepositEvent emitted with correct data

it("handles multiple deposits from same user")
// Action: Same user deposits 3 times
// Assert: All deposits succeed
// Assert: total_deposits = sum of all deposits
// Assert: Each DepositEvent captured
```

#### 2.2 Deposit Validation
**Purpose:** Enforce deposit constraints
```typescript
it("enforces minimum deposit amount")
// Action: Try to deposit 0.5 USDC (below 1 USDC minimum)
// Assert: BelowMinimum error

it("rejects zero amount deposit")
// Action: Try to deposit 0
// Assert: InvalidAmount error

it("validates vault address matches custodian")
// Action: Try to deposit to wrong vault
// Assert: InvalidVault error
```

### 3. Withdrawal Operations

#### 3.1 Protocol-Controlled Withdrawals
**Purpose:** Verify only protocol can withdraw
```typescript
it("allows protocol_authority to withdraw on behalf of users")
// Setup: Custodian with 10K USDC
// Action: protocol_authority withdraws 1K to user
// Assert: USDC transferred to recipient
// Assert: total_withdrawals increased
// Assert: WithdrawEvent emitted

it("rejects withdrawal from non-protocol authority")
// Action: Owner tries to withdraw
// Assert: Unauthorized error
// Action: Random user tries to withdraw
// Assert: Unauthorized error
```

#### 3.2 Withdrawal Validation
**Purpose:** Ensure withdrawal integrity
```typescript
it("validates recipient token account ownership")
// Setup: Create token account owned by Alice
// Action: Try to withdraw with Bob as recipient parameter
// Assert: InvalidRecipient error (account owner != recipient)

it("validates recipient token account mint")
// Setup: Create SOL token account (wrong mint)
// Action: Try to withdraw USDC to SOL account
// Assert: InvalidMint error

it("validates vault has sufficient balance")
// Setup: Vault with 100 USDC
// Action: Try to withdraw 200 USDC
// Assert: InsufficientVaultBalance error

it("validates vault address matches custodian")
// Action: Try to withdraw from wrong vault
// Assert: InvalidVault error
```

#### 3.3 Pooled Model Accounting
**Purpose:** Verify withdrawals can exceed deposits (profits)
```typescript
it("allows withdrawals exceeding deposits (user profits)")
// Setup: Total deposits = 1000 USDC
// Action: Withdraw 1500 USDC (user made profit in protocol)
// Assert: Succeeds (no check against total_deposits)
// Assert: total_withdrawals = 1500
// This is CRITICAL for the pooled zero-sum redistribution model!
// Winners can withdraw losers' deposits as profits
```

### 4. Emergency Pause

#### 4.1 Toggle Emergency Pause
**Purpose:** Test emergency halt mechanism
```typescript
it("allows owner to activate emergency pause")
// Action: Owner calls toggle_emergency_pause(true)
// Assert: emergency_pause = true

it("blocks withdrawals when paused")
// Setup: Activate emergency pause
// Action: protocol_authority tries to withdraw
// Assert: SystemPaused error

it("allows deposits even when paused")
// Setup: Emergency pause active
// Action: User deposits USDC
// Assert: Deposit succeeds (only withdrawals blocked)

it("allows owner to deactivate pause")
// Action: Owner calls toggle_emergency_pause(false)
// Assert: Withdrawals work again
```

#### 4.2 Pause Authority
**Purpose:** Verify only owner controls pause
```typescript
it("rejects pause toggle from protocol_authority")
// Action: protocol_authority tries to pause
// Assert: Unauthorized error

it("rejects pause toggle from random user")
// Action: Random user tries to pause
// Assert: Unauthorized error
```

### 5. Authority Management

#### 5.1 Update Protocol Authority
**Purpose:** Test protocol authority handover
```typescript
it("allows owner to update protocol_authority")
// Action: Owner updates protocol_authority
// Assert: New authority can withdraw
// Assert: Old authority cannot withdraw

it("rejects update from non-owner")
// Action: protocol_authority tries to update itself
// Assert: Unauthorized error

it("validates new authority is not default/system")
// Assert: InvalidAuthority errors
```

#### 5.2 Update Owner
**Purpose:** Test ownership transfer
```typescript
it("allows owner to transfer ownership")
// Action: Owner transfers to new_owner
// Assert: New owner can update authorities
// Assert: Old owner cannot update

it("validates new owner is not default/system")
// Assert: InvalidAuthority errors
```

### 6. Event Tracking

#### 6.1 Deposit Events
**Purpose:** Verify event emission for indexing
```typescript
it("emits DepositEvent with correct data")
// After deposit:
// Assert: Event contains depositor pubkey
// Assert: Event contains amount
// Assert: Event contains timestamp
```

#### 6.2 Withdraw Events
**Purpose:** Track withdrawals off-chain
```typescript
it("emits WithdrawEvent with correct data")
// After withdrawal:
// Assert: Event contains recipient pubkey
// Assert: Event contains amount
// Assert: Event contains authority (who approved)
// Assert: Event contains timestamp
```

### 7. Integration with Off-Chain System

#### 7.1 Deposit Indexing Simulation
**Purpose:** Verify deposit tracking feasibility
```typescript
it("generates indexable deposit events")
// Execute 10 deposits from different users
// Parse transaction logs for events
// Assert: Can reconstruct deposit history
// Assert: Can map depositor -> amount
```

#### 7.2 Balance Reconciliation
**Purpose:** Verify off-chain tracking accuracy
```typescript
it("maintains reconcilable pool balance")
// After series of deposits/withdrawals:
// Note: vault.amount ≠ total_deposits - total_withdrawals
// Because total_withdrawals can exceed total_deposits (profits)
// The vault balance represents current pooled funds
// Off-chain system must track individual agent stakes
```

### 8. Attack Vectors

#### 8.1 Direct Vault Manipulation
**Purpose:** Prevent bypassing custodian
```typescript
it("prevents direct transfers from vault")
// Try to transfer USDC directly from vault
// Assert: Only custodian PDA can sign
```

#### 8.2 Fake Recipient Account
**Purpose:** Prevent fund redirection
```typescript
it("prevents withdrawal to attacker-controlled account")
// Setup: Attacker creates token account
// Action: Try to specify victim as recipient but attacker's account
// Assert: InvalidRecipient (owner check fails)
```

#### 8.3 Drainage Attack
**Purpose:** Verify vault protection
```typescript
it("prevents complete vault drainage without authority")
// Multiple attack attempts:
// - Non-authority withdrawal
// - Fake vault reference
// - Direct transfer attempt
// Assert: All fail with appropriate errors
```

## Implemented Tests (16 tests, all passing)

### 1. Custodian Initialization (2 tests)
- ✅ 1.1 Singleton Custodian Creation (2 tests)
  - Initializes custodian with owner and protocol authority
  - Prevents duplicate custodian initialization

**Note**: Authority validation on initialization exists in the contract (see `initialize_custodian.rs`) but cannot be tested in isolation because VeritasCustodian is a singleton with fixed PDA seeds. Authority validation is tested via update operations instead.

### 2. Deposit Operations (2 tests)
- ✅ 2.1 Permissionless Deposits
  - Allows any user to deposit USDC
  - Handles multiple deposits from same user

### 3. Withdrawal Operations (2 tests)
- ✅ 3.1 Protocol-Controlled Withdrawals
  - Allows protocol_authority to withdraw on behalf of users
  - Rejects withdrawal from non-protocol authority (2 sub-tests: owner + random user)
- ✅ 3.3 Pooled Model Accounting
  - Allows withdrawals exceeding deposits (user profits)

### 4. Emergency Pause (4 tests)
- ✅ 4.1 Toggle Emergency Pause
  - Allows owner to activate emergency pause
  - Blocks withdrawals when paused
  - Allows deposits even when paused
  - Allows owner to deactivate pause
- ✅ 4.2 Pause Authority
  - Rejects pause toggle from protocol_authority
  - Rejects pause toggle from random user

### 5. Authority Management (2 tests)
- ✅ 5.1 Update Protocol Authority
  - Allows owner to update protocol_authority
  - Rejects update from non-owner

## Important Tests Still Missing

### High Priority (Should Implement)
1. **Specific Error Code Assertions** - Replace generic error checks
   - Currently: Some tests use `assert.ok(err)` without checking error codes
   - Should: Check exact Anchor error codes throughout
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Value: High - catches wrong error types

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
2. **Withdrawal Validation Tests** - Input validation
   - Validate recipient token account ownership
   - Validate recipient token account mint
   - Validate vault has sufficient balance
   - Validate vault address matches custodian
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Value: Medium - validates safety checks

3. **Deposit Validation Tests** - Input validation
   - Enforce minimum deposit amount
   - Reject zero amount deposit
   - Validate vault address matches custodian
   - Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Value: Medium - prevents invalid operations

4. **Update Owner Test** - Ownership transfer
   - Allows owner to transfer ownership
   - Validates new owner is not default/system
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Value: Medium - governance feature

### Low Priority (Skip Unless Needed)
5. **Event Tracking Tests** - Off-chain indexing
   - Verify DepositEvent emission
   - Verify WithdrawEvent emission
   - Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Value: Low - depends on off-chain requirements

6. **Integration Lifecycle Test** - Complete scenario
   - Full custodian lifecycle simulation
   - Effort: 2 hours
   - Value: Low - already covered by individual tests

### Not Recommended (Remove from Scope)
- **Attack Vector Tests** - Security audit concern (direct vault manipulation, drainage)
- **Edge Cases** - Maximum values, rapid operations (unnecessary complexity)
- **Performance Benchmarks** - Use profiling tools instead
- **Account Size Validation** - Fragile, low value
- **Balance Reconciliation** - Complex off-chain tracking (integration test)

## Test Data Configuration (Already Implemented)

### Mock Setup
```typescript
// Keypairs
owner = Keypair.generate();
protocolAuthority = Keypair.generate();
testUser1 = Keypair.generate();
testUser2 = Keypair.generate();

// USDC Mint: Mock USDC with 6 decimals
// Users funded with 10K USDC each
// Custodian PDA: ["custodian"]
// Vault PDA: ["custodian_vault"]
```

## Critical Implementation Learnings

### 1. Pooled Zero-Sum Model
- **Key Feature:** Withdrawals can exceed deposits (user profits)
- **Implementation:** No check that total_withdrawals ≤ total_deposits
- **Reason:** Winners withdraw more than they deposited (from losers' deposits)
- **Test Coverage:** ✅ Validated in 3.3 Pooled Model Accounting

### 2. Emergency Pause Asymmetry
- **Design:** Pause blocks withdrawals but allows deposits
- **Reason:** Protects user funds without preventing new deposits
- **Implementation:** Withdrawal instruction checks emergency_pause flag
- **Test Coverage:** ✅ Validated in 4.1 Toggle Emergency Pause

### 3. Dual Authority Model
- **Owner:** Controls pause, authority updates, governance
- **Protocol Authority:** Only controls withdrawals (fund movement)
- **Separation:** Security through separation of concerns
- **Test Coverage:** ✅ Validated throughout tests

### 4. Error Assertion Patterns
- **Current:** Generic error checks with string matching
- **Issue:** May not catch wrong error types
- **Improvement Needed:** Use specific Anchor error code assertions
- **Example:** `err.error?.errorCode?.code === "Unauthorized"`

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Improve Error Assertions** (Quick Win)
   - Replace remaining string matching with error code checks
   - Standardize error assertion pattern across all tests
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Value: High

2. **Add Input Validation Tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Withdrawal validation tests (4 tests)
   - Deposit validation tests (3 tests)
   - Effort: 3-5 hours
   - Value: Medium
